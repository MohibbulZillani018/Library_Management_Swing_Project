# Library_Management_Swing_Project

Library Management System
This Java-based Library Management System is designed to handle essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing library books. Built using Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI), the application offers an intuitive user experience with aesthetically pleasing design elements and efficient functionality.
Features:
- Add Books: Insert book details including Book ID, Title, Author, Publisher, Year of Publication, ISBN, and Number of Copies.
- View Books: Display all records in a table for easy viewing and management.
- Edit Book Information: Update existing records based on the Book ID.
- Delete Books: Remove records by providing the corresponding Book ID.
- Clear Fields: Reset input fields for seamless data entry.
- Exit System: Close the application safely.

Highlights:
- Interactive and accessible user interface designed with Swing components.
- Data is stored in-memory using an ArrayList.
- Utilizes ActionListener for responsive button actions.
- Lightweight application suitable for small-scale library management.

Potential Enhancements:
- Validation for numeric fields and duplicate Book ID entries.
- Persistent data storage using file handling or database integration (e.g., MySQL, SQLite).
- Advanced error handling to prevent runtime issues.
- Implementation of Object-Oriented Programming principles for improved scalability.
